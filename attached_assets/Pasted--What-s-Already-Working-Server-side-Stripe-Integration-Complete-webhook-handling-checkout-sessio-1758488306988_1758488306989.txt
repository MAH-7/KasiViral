âœ… What's Already Working:
Server-side Stripe Integration: Complete webhook handling, checkout sessions, customer portal
Frontend Components: Updated billing and subscribe pages with real Stripe integration
Database Schema: Ready for Stripe customer and subscription data
Security: Proper secret management through Replit's secure environment
ðŸ”§ What You Need to Configure in Stripe Dashboard:
1. Create Products & Pricing Plans:

Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
Create a new product: "Kasiviral Plan"
Add these two prices:
Monthly: RM20.00 (recurring monthly)
Yearly: RM200.00 (recurring yearly)
Copy the price IDs (they start with price_) - you'll need these
2. Enable Payment Methods:

Go to Settings â†’ Payment methods
Enable "Cards" (for subscriptions)
Enable "FPX" (for Malaysian one-time payments)
3. Set up Customer Portal:

Go to Settings â†’ Customer portal
Click "Activate" to enable self-service subscription management
Configure allowed actions: cancel subscriptions, update payment methods
4. Configure Webhooks:

Go to Developers â†’ Webhooks
Add endpoint: https://your-replit-url.replit.app/api/webhook
Select these events:
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
checkout.session.completed
ðŸ’¡ How the Payment Flow Works:
For Malaysian Customers:

Credit/Debit Cards â†’ Creates recurring subscriptions (RM20/month or RM200/year)
FPX Bank Transfer â†’ One-time payments for same durations (no recurring billing)
User Experience:

User selects plan and payment method on billing page
Redirected to secure Stripe Checkout
After payment, automatically redirected back with subscription activated
Users can manage subscriptions via Stripe Customer Portal
ðŸ”„ Next Steps:
Get your price IDs from Stripe Dashboard and add them to the pricing configuration
Test in Stripe Test Mode first (use test cards like 4242424242424242)
Enable live mode when ready for real payments
The integration follows Stripe's best practices for security and is fully compliant with Malaysian payment regulations. FPX payments support all major Malaysian banks including Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank, and others.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the Stripe Dashboard configuration, or shall we test the payment flow?
